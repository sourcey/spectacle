# Install

Sourcey ships through every channel JavaScript, native, and container ecosystems use. Pick the one your project already lives in.

## Sourcey CLI

The full Sourcey binary that handles OpenAPI, Doxygen, godoc, MCP, and Markdown sources.

### npm

Requires Node 20 or later.

```bash
npm install -g sourcey
sourcey init
```

For one-shot use without a global install:

```bash
npx sourcey init
```

### Homebrew

Works on macOS and Linuxbrew.

```bash
brew tap sourcey/tap
brew install sourcey
sourcey init
```

The formula installs Sourcey through Node under the hood, so it depends on `node`. If you already have Node, the npm path is a smaller install.

### Docker

The official `sourcey/sourcey` image runs every CLI command. The image's `WORKDIR` is `/docs` and its `ENTRYPOINT` is `sourcey`, so the first argument after the image name becomes the subcommand.

Initialize a new project (interactive):

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/docs sourcey/sourcey init
```

Build:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/docs sourcey/sourcey build
```

Run the dev server. The container needs `--host 0.0.0.0` so the dev server binds outside the loopback interface, and `-p 4400:4400` to forward the port to the host:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4400:4400 -v "$PWD":/docs sourcey/sourcey dev --host 0.0.0.0
```

On Linux, files written by the container are owned by root by default. Pass `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` to keep them owned by your user.

On Windows PowerShell, use `${PWD}` instead of `"$PWD"`.

### Nix

Requires a Nix install with flakes enabled.

One-shot run:

```bash
nix run github:sourcey/sourcey
```

Persistent install:

```bash
nix profile install github:sourcey/sourcey
sourcey init
```

## Standalone Go docs generator

For Go-only consumers without a JavaScript toolchain, `sourcey-godoc` ships as a separate native binary. It produces static Go docs sites or portable `godoc.json` snapshots; no Sourcey npm package required.

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/sourcey/sourcey/go/sourcey-godoc/cmd/sourcey-godoc@latest
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap sourcey/tap
brew install sourcey-godoc
```

### Scoop (Windows)

```powershell
scoop bucket add sourcey https://github.com/sourcey/scoop-bucket
scoop install sourcey-godoc
```

## Local development

To work on Sourcey itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourcey/sourcey.git
cd sourcey
npm install
npm run build && npm test
```
